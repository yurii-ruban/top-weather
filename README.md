## Purpose

The **Weather App** project aims developers to be acquainted with `fetch API`, `Promises`, `Async/await` mechanisms. And of course practicing with HTML, styling and DOM-manipulation to consolidate previously acquired knowledge.
Also, there is one more thing I wanted to practive - is setup and bundle the project with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) tool, which looks great for some small unassuming projects like this one.

The task is to just create simple weather App by following [these](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) instructions.
